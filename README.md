>You will be given assignments as your first/last round. They just want to know how you follow the standards. Some ask for UI thing, other ask for architectural patterns. Just check your methods and play well with the logic.That’s all.

### That’s all Guys. The moment I come out of the interview room, I always note down the questions on Google Keep. Blogs & Github links helped me so much in cracking these interviews. See Now I can help others too -:)

If you learn about the concepts for the above questions, I am sure you will get your basics strong and with the strong basics, you can easily crack any interview.

I have written an [article](https://blog.usejournal.com/interview-questions-for-android-java-ds-f5081cb3aa09) on the same.

If you have more questions, I will be happy to learn, add & share. Please raise a [PR](https://github.com/niharika2810/android-interview-questions/compare) and contribute. :-)
